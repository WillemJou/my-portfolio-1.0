# This is my port-folio ! üå±

Here is my [portfolio](https://willemjou.github.io/my-portfolio/), started with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) using the `npm create vite@latest --template react-ts` cli and design with the help of [Astro](https://astro.build/) !

The Astro template:

## Made with React + TypeScript + Vite

I used the React library, but also TypeScript for the typing as well as Vite for the environment. The perfect combo for my portfolio !

## The other library I used

I implemented my routing using [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) (their documentation is really great!)

Otherwise I did everything "bear hand" ! üêª
