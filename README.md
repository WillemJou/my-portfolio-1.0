# This is my port-folio 1.0 ! 🌴

Here is my [portfolio](https://willemjou.github.io/my-portfolio/), started with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and design with a template from [Astro](https://astro.build/) !

Astro template:

## Made with React + TypeScript + Vite

I used the React library, but also TypeScript for the typing as well as Vite for the environment.

## The other library I used

I implemented my routing using [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)

Otherwise I did everything "bear hand" ! 🐻
